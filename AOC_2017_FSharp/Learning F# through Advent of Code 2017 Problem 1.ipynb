This seems like the most fun way to adjust to the F# syntax and also do some delightful functional programming in the process!\n",

    "\n",
    "Take a moment to read it through... awesome! Now let's see if we can tease some data out of what it says!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to review a **sequence of digits** (basically a list).\n",
    "We have to find the **sum** of all digits that match the **next** digit in the list.\n",
    "The list is **circular** so the digit after the last digit is the first digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmmm...\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to compare a list value to the value ahead of it. I'm sure there are clever ways to do this, but the easiest way is to simply **make a list that's a duplicate of the first one but with the first element shifted to the back.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Then each element in the first list will match up with the element in the second that we want to compare it against.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can process the lists in parallel, checking their values and pumping the response into a third list, containing the result of the comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\*Note: When I first attempted this question, I simply assumed that a list of numbers could be used as input. I later realized that the \"sequence\" referred spicifically to a string of digits. I've left the original answer up, but will add an addendum at the bottom with an update for moving from a string of characters into the proposed solution.\n"
